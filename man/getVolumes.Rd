\title{Get a list of available volumes}
\usage{
getVolumes(exclude)
}
\arguments{
\item{exclude}{A vector of volume names to be excluded from the return value}
}
\value{
A function returning a named vector of available volumes
}
\description{
This function is intended as an input to the roots parameter in
\code{\link{fileGetter}} and \code{\link{shinyFileChoose}}. It returns a
function that returns a named vector of available volumes on the system. This
construction makes it dynamic so that a shinyFiles instance reflects new
volumes as they get added (e.g. usb drives). The function takes a single
argument giving names of volumes the developer wants removed from the return
value.
}
\details{
The function is OS specific and looks for volumes/drives in different places
depending on the system on which shiny is running.
\describe{
 \item{Windows}{Returns all drives mapped to a letter}
 \item{Mac OSX}{Looks in /Volumes/ and lists the directories therein}
 \item{Linux}{Returns the system root}
}
If the function does not recognize the system under which it is running it
will throw an error
}
